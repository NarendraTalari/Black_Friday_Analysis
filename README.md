# Black Friday Day Sales Analysis Using Seaborn

This project focuses on analyzing Black Friday sales data to uncover trends and insights. The analysis uses **Seaborn** to visualize the distribution of sales, compare sales trends across different days of the week, and identify monthly sales patterns. It helps in understanding customer behavior during major retail events like Black Friday.

## Features
- Visualizes sales distribution on Black Friday using histograms.
- Compares sales performance across different days of the week.
- Analyzes monthly sales trends to highlight spikes in sales during Black Friday.
- Data is represented using various plots such as histograms, boxplots, and line plots.

## Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
